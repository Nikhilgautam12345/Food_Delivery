This project utilizes React.js, Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, it is integrated with the live Swiggy API to fetch real-time data about restaurants, menus, and others. Please make sure to use a CORS extension in your browser to allow cross-origin requests to the Swiggy API.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
